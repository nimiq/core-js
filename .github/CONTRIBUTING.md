# Contributing Guidelines

For anyone looking to get involved to this project, we are glad to hear from you. Here are a few of the kind of contributions
that we would be interested.

*  Bug fixes
    -  If you find a bug, please first report it using GitHub issues.
    -  Issues that have already been identified as a bug will be labeled `bug`.
    -  If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, create a Pull Request from your own fork and mention the issue number.
        +  Include a test that isolates the bug and verifies that it was fixed.
*  New Features
    -  If you'd like to accomplish something in the library that it doesn't already do, describe the problem in a new
       GitHub issue.
    -  Issues that have been identified as a feature request will be labeled `enhancement`.
    -  If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project maintainers before spending
       too much time writing the code. In some cases, `enhancement`s may not align well with the project objectives at
       the time.
*  Tests, Documentation, Miscellaneous
    -  If you think the test coverage could be improved, the documentation could be clearer, you've got an alternative
       implementation of something that may have more advantages, or any other change we would be glad hear about
       it.
       -  If it's a trivial change, go ahead and create a Pull Request with the changes you have in mind
       -  If not, open a GitHub issue to discuss the idea first.

## Requirements

For a contribution to be accepted:

*  The test suite must be complete and pass
*  Code must follow existing styling conventions
*  Commit messages must be descriptive. Related issues should be mentioned by number.

If the contribution doesn't meet these criteria, a maintainer will discuss with you on the issue. You can still
continue to add more commits to the branch you have sent the Pull Request from.
