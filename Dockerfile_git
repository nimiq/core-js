# Just execute the nimiq process. One can customize the created container easily
# to one's needs by (at least) the following options:
# - supply your own arguments to the entrypoint while creating the container, e.g.
#    docker run nimiq/nodejs-client --miner
# - just bind mount your own nimiq.conf to the container at /etc/nimiq/nimiq.conf
#   then you can just create the container like (assuming the config is in the
#   current working directory)
#     docker run nimiq/nodejs-client -v $(pwd)/nimiq.conf:/etc/nimiq/nimiq.conf --config=/etc/nimiq.conf
# (- of course, you can combine and modify these options suitable to your needs)
